# My personal configuration files

These files should work on all major Linux distributions as long as the required packages are installed.
I'm using *bash*, so no fancy *zsh* configuration.

## Setup

    # Clone repository
    git clone https://github.com/meonwax/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

    # Symlink wanted files
    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc
